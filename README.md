# WeatherApp-with-Streamlit

# Introduction
My attempt to make a weather app with Kafka and Streamlit is still in the works, and would love someone to help out.

# Instructions
1. Install the libs with the requirements.txt file. 
2. Edit the zookeeper, kafka-server and topic files to the correct dir (where your kafka and zookeeper are). You can also just run Kafka in other ways, just name the topic dataflow.
3. In the terminal, run 'streamlit run Home.py'.

# Improvements
As of the writing of this, the app isn't working as I planned. The UI isn't great and the Weather.py keeps repeating the output ( I can't really explain it, you would  have to run it to see). I just need to figure out how to use Streamlit better.
